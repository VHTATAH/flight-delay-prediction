## Overview
**Federal Aviation Administration** estimated that flight delays cost the airline industry $8 billion a year, much of it due to increased spending on crews, fuel and maintenance. Delays cost passengers even more - nearly $17 billion.

In this project I used machine Learning techniques to predict flight arrival delays for Boston Logan Airport. Various prediction models were developed and evaluated. Data was visually represented using graphs and charts.

## Data
Since June 2003, the airlines that report on-time data also report the causes of delays and cancellations to the **Bureau of Transportation Statistics**. Reported causes of delay are available from June 2003 to the most recent month and can be downloaded from the official goverment website: https://www.transportation.gov/
